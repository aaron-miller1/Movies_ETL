# Movies_ETL

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to take movie data and its ratings and clean/organize it with Jupyter Notebook and Postgres to create a readable dataframe for thousands of movies and millions of ratings among them. After Extracting, Transforming, and Loading this data I have successfully created a more visually pleasing database that can be used for other projects.
